Step 1: Understanding the Model

From the thesis, the model consists of:

43 governing equations (energy conservation, power balance, pressure balance)

A precooler model using a 2D spatial discretization

Heat exchanger calculations using NTU-effectiveness and empirical correlations

Our goal is to numerically solve these equations and simulate:

Thermodynamic Cycle of the SABRE Engine

Performance Parameters at different flight conditions

Precooler Heat Exchange Process
