## (e) Program Description
This program calculates the performance and design parameters of a ramjet engine based on ideal assumptions. It includes thermal and propulsive efficiency calculations and supports parametric studies over various design variables.

## (f) Algorithms Used
Algorithms based on compressible flow relations (isentropic flow, shock relations, Rayleigh flow) were implemented using theoretical models from:

Aircraft Propulsion by Saeed Farokhi (2nd Ed.)
J. D. Anderson, **Modern Compressible Flow**: With Historical Perspective, 3rd Edition, McGraw-Hill
Education, New York, 2002.
Antonella Ingenito, **Subsonic Combustion Ramjet Design**, Springer, 2021.

Adjustments were made to enable parametric evaluations and plotting functionality.
