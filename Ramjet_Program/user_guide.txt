## (d) Date of Initial Coding
February 2025

## (e) Program Description
This program calculates the performance and design parameters of a ramjet engine based on ideal assumptions. It includes thermal and propulsive efficiency calculations and supports parametric studies over various design variables.

## (f) Algorithms Used
Algorithms based on compressible flow relations (isentropic flow, shock relations, Rayleigh flow) were implemented using theoretical models from:

1-'Aircraft Propulsion' by Saeed Farokhi (2nd Ed.)
2-J. D. Anderson, 'Modern Compressible Flow: With Historical Perspective', 3rd Edition, McGraw-Hill
Education, New York, 2002.
3-Antonella Ingenito, 'Subsonic Combustion Ramjet Design', Springer, 2021.

Adjustments were made to enable parametric evaluations and plotting functionality.

## (g) Inputs
- Free-stream pressure (Pa)
- Free-stream temperature (K)
